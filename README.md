# Organ Transplant Finder

## Inspiration
According to the American Transplant Foundation, around 107000 people in the US are currently in need of a lifesaving organ transplant. These recipients are selected based on location, medical need and compatibility.

## Goal
As we aim to assist recipients in their path to treatment, we focused on connecting patients to Organ Transplant Centers.

## What it does
With our tool, patients can quickly find clinics by filtering what services are available. Moreover, to facilitate the user's experience, the tool also provides a quick overview of each institution's information.

## How we built it
Our web app was built mainly with React.js. The core of the project is our map which we implemented using the Google Maps JavaScript API, and populated it with data gathered from the Health and Services Administration

## Challenges we ran into
At first our team wanted to use the Deck.gl framework to layer over the map and provide other data visualization and functionalities to our users, however due to the lack of time we had to compromise and focus on the core features of our app. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to create a project that positively impact our community. Moreover we are also proud of thinking objectively under pressure and focusing on the main features of our project when we ran into a obstacle to make sure we still had a great app. Finally, we are also proud of submitting this project as it is the very first hackathon that any of our team members have ever participated.

## What we learned
As first time hackers, we learned more about working under pressure, and cooperating to create a great demo project. Our team members also had the opportunity to learn usages of the systems we've used to build our project, as none of our team members had extensive experience with either the React library or the Google Maps JavaScript API.
